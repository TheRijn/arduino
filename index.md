Learn how to program the Arduino!

The exercises on this website assume that you know C or C++. For the rest no prior knowledge is required.

## What is the Arduino?

## Basics
If you haven't yet done any Arduino programming, start with the basics. There is a build-up in the exercises, so start at 'Blink' and gradually work your way down the list.

## Challenges
If you are a bit more comfortable with the Arduino concepts, you could try one of the challenges from the menu above.

## Background
In this section you will find some background information that could prove to be useful for the exercises.

## Resources
For those who would like to continue with the Arduino on their own, I invite you to have a look in the resource section.
